## Description
This Independent Study Project's goal was to learn C++ and achieve something that is impossible with a different programming language. My mission was to improve Windows Explorer, a closed-source software by Microsoft, by modifying its code in memory to display different wallpapers for each virtual window (inspired by Linux and OS X).

## Goals
* Learn the fundamentals of C/++
* Understand and achieve native function hooking
* Utilize the newly-acquired skills to improve Windows Explorer

## Results
* Learned the fundamentals of C/++ and developed basic fluency
* Vastly improved fluency and understanding of the Assembly language (ASM)
* Learned how Portable Executables are executed and stored in memory
  * PE structure
  * ASLR
* Memory patching and injection
* Native function hooking
  * Using various helper libraries
  * Manually
* Explored various system APIs to achieve the aforementioned
* Partially achieved the final goal, but time constraints and a sudden Windows update prevented that from happening
